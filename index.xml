      <description>Situation A developer from one of the feature teams raised a ticket to be granted access to the production database. They have tested their requirement to provide reports against statistical data in a non production environment and now need production access to inform a local job service trial and future national reporting. They have already raised a ticket with the Secure Design Systems team and have been granted authorisation under DWP guidelines to access the production database for a defined time period.</description>

      <description>Situation Legacy accounts were created for dedicated applications which are now defunct with resources in these accounts still incurring costs to the organisation. Automating the deletion of AWS resources in legacy accounts is required for reducing costs and security risks.
Task My colleague and I were tasked with auditing legacy accounts, recording costs, and creating a solution for automating the removal of resources after migrating application logs to a new and dedicated log account.</description>

      <description>Situation Configuration of Jenkins controller and agents is done by means of a Jenkins module which holds all of the Jenkins configuration in a mixture of xml and other files.
Task In order to standardize the configuration, consul templates should be used to configure the application within the terraform-aws-jenkins module.
Action I decided to use the Plan-Do-Check-Act problem solving technique in my workflow for this ticket as I felt it would be most appropriate.</description>
