legacy account mentioned so I could look at the Lambda function there as well as any roles, permissions and SNS settings that I might need to familiarise myself

<p><strong>My Plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Research AWS Lambda and decide if the legacy account Lambda could be revised and resused in the new project</li>
<li>Research AWS SNS and the new concepts of topics and subscriptions which would needed</li>
<li>Set up the infrastructure to deploy the Lambda function in a sandbox environment within an example application Terraform stack in the exisiting codebase</li>
<li>Test that adding or removing objects from a test bucket triggered notifications to my Slack</li>
<li>Move the changes into the project Terraform stack and through sandbox, stage and finally production</li>
</ul>
<p>My LM agreed this was a good approach and so I moved the ticket into &lsquo;in progress&rsquo; and started to work.</p>
<p>The Terraform stack for an example application within our codebase introduced me to new concepts that I had not covered in the bootcamp. The Terraform is
split into modules that do different things within the infrastructure such as creating S3 buckets, creating IAM roles and setting permissions, setting up the
network, and deploying a Lambda function. The modules are all version controlled within a GitLab repositories and to call a module into th eproject for use

<ul>
<li>iam.tf - which contains all of the IAM roles, granting permissions for the Lambda</li>
<li>project.tf - which invokes the different modules</li>
<li>lambda.tf in the lambda module - to set up infrastructure for the Lambda function, zip the lambda and deploy it</li>
