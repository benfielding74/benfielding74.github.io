      <description>Situation In order to patch vulnerabilities and install software version updates so as to decrease the attack surface or servers and ensure they are equipped to support feature team applications, a process is in place within our department that builds a new Amazon Machine Image. This is then updated within the application and infrastructure stacks by applying Terraform before finally Auto Scaling Group refreshes are manually carried out to apply the new launch templates.</description>

      <description>Situation Within DWP Digital we have a Portfolio team who have overall responsibility for the products and feature teams. When our team need to give updates on progress with platform infrastructure for apps or new products there is sometimes confusion about the tools, processes and language we use as the team is non-technical.
Task Myself and another apprentice were asked if we would prepare and deliver a 15 minute presentation to facilitate knowledge sharing with the Portfolio team.</description>
