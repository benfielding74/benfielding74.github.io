      <description>Situation A request for a feature was added to team Kanban board. In a legacy project the Devs received a notification to a Slack channel whenever a file is added or deleted from their S3 buckets. They were requesting that this functionality be added to the current project.
As a developer I would like to receive a notification into the #uc-far-prod-alerts Slack channel whenever an object is added to or deleted from the new S3 buckets.</description>
